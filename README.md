# Burger

**Intro**

This Burger assignment is a restaurant app that allows the user to enter burgers into a database, which are then displayed, and provide an option to "devour" the item. Once the item is devoured, it is marked as so in the database, and then the item is moved to another location on the page. The application also offers the user the opportunity to enter new burgers into the database.

This application utilizes MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and Sequelize to gather, display and record the information about the various burgers. Additionally, the application follows an MVC design pattern.

**About Bob's Eat Da Burger Application**

I chose the Fox television show Bob's Burgers as my theme for this project. It felt like a good fit considering the underlying subject matter was food, specifically burgers. The items that are pre-set into the database are burgers featured in the show. I encourage users to include their own burgers from the show into the list. Follow this link to a Thrillist article that lists every burger featured in the show if you need some ideas: https://bit.ly/1PHA2sY.

**Application DEMO**

Part of the assignment requirements was to deploy the application to Heroku. You can check out the program here: https://fierce-stream-69652.herokuapp.com/
